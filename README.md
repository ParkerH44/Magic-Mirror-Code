# Magic Mirror
You take a two way mirror and put a monitor behind it and then when the display is turned on, it shows through the monitor so you can see it.
I used a news api https://newsapi.org to get the news headlines and a weather api https://openweathermap.org/api to get the weather.
I found an older monitor that I can take apart and used that for the screen.
