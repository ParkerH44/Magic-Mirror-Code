# Magic Mirror
I used a raspberry pi 4 and created software using python and the tkinter library to create a display that shows the time, weather, the top three news headlines, and a list of tasks/reminders that I have.
You take a two way mirror and put a monitor behind it and then when the display is turned on, it shows through the monitor so you can see it.
I used a news api https://newsapi.org to get the news headlines and a weather api https://openweathermap.org/api to get the weather.
For the reminders I used todoist because they provide an api for free so I can put reminders into the app on my phone and using the api I can access them from the raspberry pi and display them.
I found an older monitor that I can take apart and used that for the screen.
